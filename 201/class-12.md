# Storage

- If your native client application needs local storage beyond key/value pairs , you can embed your own database, invent your own file format or any other solutions. REMEMBER Access DB's!  

**Cookies**
1. slow down by reading them at every request - transmitting
1. slow down by sending unencrypted data
1. limitation is 4KB of data.

**What we rally realy want!**
1. Lots of storage space
1. On the client side
1. perists beyond a page refresh
1. isn't transmitted to the server


*userData allows web pages to store up to 64KB of data per domain, in a hierarchical SML-based structure*

*Data is stored as strings. If you are storing something other than a string, youâ€™ll need to coerce it yourself when you retrieve it.*
