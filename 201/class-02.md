# Class Day 2 Notes

### From the Duckett HTML book:

## Chapter 2: “Text” (pp.40-61)

**HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page
- h1-6
- p
- b
- i
- sup
- br
- sub

Just like word processors.

** Semantic Markup are added for extra information but does not change the structure.
- strong
- em
- blockquote
- q
- cite

these elements emphasize the text but not structure of the webpage `(page 50 - 56)`

## Chapter 10: Ch.10 “Introducing CSS” (pp.226-245)

CSS treats each HTML element as it appears inside it's own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look

<img src="../images/szechuanporkbowl.jpg" height ="150px"  align="right">

Rules are made of of selectsrs - that specify the elements the rule applies to

Declarations is what indicates what these elements should look like

Differrent types of selectors allow you to targe your rules at different elements

declarations are made up of two parts

  1. the properties of the elements
  1. the Values of those properties

CSS rules usually appear in a separate document but you may do them inline within the HTML page.

**Thenk of CSS as putting all elements into a box**

- Css allows you to create rules that aonctorl the way each individual box and the contents of that bos are presented.
  - Internal style `<style>` within HTML
  - external style - `<link href=css/styles.css tyep="text/css" rel="stylesheet"/>`

  External you change the declarations once where internal you have to change it every instance.

### From the Duckett JS book:

## Chapter 2: “Basic JavaScript Instructions” (pp.53-84)

- Scrips are a series of statments that are read one line at a time and processed `-` a recipe
- Precise Instructions
- Variables can be used to store pieces of information
  - `var firstname;` declaring a variable.
  `firstname = 'Michael' setting the variables value 
    - String
    - Numeric
    - Boolean

- Arrays `(hate them)` are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related informaiont

- JS distinguishes between `0 - 9`, strings, and boolean values
  - Numeric and string can be compared in some instances
  - Boolean is either 1 or 0 - True or False

- Expressions evaluate into a single value

- expressions rely on operators to calculate a value

## Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” only up to the section on switch statements (pp.145-162)
