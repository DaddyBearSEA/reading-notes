### From the Duckett HTML book:

## Chapter 4: Ch.4 “Links” (pp.74-93)

- Links are created using the `<a> `element

- the `<a>` element usses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.

 - when linking to a page within your own site, use relative links rather than qualified URLS

 - create links to open email programs with an email address in the 'To' field

 - use the Id attribute to targe elements within a page that can be linked to.




## Chapter 15: “Layout” (pp.358-404)
Note: This layout chapter is BIG. Focus your attention on understanding the core concepts presented on pp.358-364, and look at the code samples on the website that accompanies the textbook. You will have another reading assignment on this chapter, so do not try to digest it all now.

- `<div>` elements are often used as contaiing elements to group together sections of a page

    > Css treate each HTML element as if it's in its own box => Block-level or inline box

- browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute or fixed positions.

- the Float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts
- floated items require a defined width

- pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts
- Best practice is 960 - 1000 px wide
- Best practice is to use the top 600 px to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling
- grids help create professionla and flexible designs
-  css frame works provide rules for common tasks
- you can include multiple css fiels in one page






### From the Duckett JS book:

## Chapter 3 (first part): “Functions, Methods, and Objects” (pp.86-99 ONLY)

#### Declaring a Function
- Name the Function that has meaning
- Declare the Function
- Calling the Function

  . Parameters vs Arguments

    > Parameters and arguments are used interchageably but they are different
    > Parameters are the items within the parentheses of the function.
    > Arguments are the items or variables that you put into the parameters.



## Article: [“6 Reasons for Pair Programming”](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

1. Greater Efficiancy
    > Research indicates that pair programing takes slightly longer, but produces higher-quality code
1. Engaged Collaboration
    > the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone

    > Codefellows rule is 15 Minutes
1. Learning from fellow Students

    > Everyone has a different approach to problem solving; working with a teammate can expose developers to techniques they otherwise would not have thought of.

1. Social Skills
    > getting good at finding the right words is a skill unto itself

    > Pair programming is great for improving social skills. When working with someone who has a different coding style, communication is key.

1. Job Interview readiness

    > many interview processes involves pair programming between a current employee and an applicant

    > the ability to work with and learn from others and stellar communication skills are as (or more!) important to a company than specific technical skills. Ryan Pederson from MS in the PPHH said this exact thing!


1. Work Environment readiness

    > Many companies that utilize pair programing expect to train fresh hires from CS-degree programs on how they operate to actually deliver a product. 
    
    > Code Fellows graduates who are already familiar with how pairing works can hit the ground running at a new job, with one less hurdle to overcome.
