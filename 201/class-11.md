# Readings : Audio, Video, Images


#### From the Duckett HTML book:

## Chapter 16: “Images” (pp.406-427)

### you can specify the dimensions of images using CSS this is very helpful when you use the same sized images on several pages of your site
`img.large {`

`  width: 500px;`

`  height: 500px;`

`}`

**NOTE:** *whenever you use consitently sized images across a site you can use CSS to control the dimensions of the images, instead of putting the dimensions in the HTML.*

### Images can be aligned obth horizontally and vertically using CSS
`img.align-left{`

`float: left;`

`margin-right: 10px;`

`}`
**NOTE:** *it is also common to add a margin to the image to ensure htat the text does no touch their edges.*

`img.align-center {}`


### background images can appear just once or be repeated across the background of the box

`background-image: url("images/yourimage.jpg)`
`background-repeat: repeat-x;`
`backgroung-attachment: fixed;`

### you can create image rollover effects by moving the background position of an image
`a.botton:hover {`

`}`

Gradiesnts as well!

### to reduce the number of images your browser has to load, you can create image sprites.

**See pg 417**

the advantage of using spries is theat the web browser only needs to request one image rather than many images, which can make the web page load faster.*

## Chapter 19: “Practical Information” (476-492)

Google Analytics is probably the best tool.

### To put your site on the web, you will need to obtain a domain name and webhosting.

I love to use [SITEGROUND](https://www.siteground.com/).
[wordpress.com](https://www.wordpress.com) - Great place to practice
I use to use NETWORK solutions but then they got purchased and service went downhill.

### FTP programs allow you to transfer files from your local computer to your web server

Most hosting sites will give you FTP or have a Browser FTP system to use.

### many companies provide platforms for bloggine, email newsletters, e-commerce and other popular website tools (to save you writing them from scratch).
I used to use Constant Contact. Went through their 1 day bootcamp on best practices and analytics of reports.

[This MDN article on audio and video elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Video_and_audio_APIs)

`<video></video>`

`<audio></audio>`

`HTMLMediaElement.play()`
`.pause`  


#### CSS

`.controls`

`.player:hover {}`

`button:before {}` contols the CSS for html `<button></button>`

visibility is set to 'hidden' and then we would change that to 'visible'

use the `opacity: 0.5;`  then `opacity: 1;`

`.timer` controls

`.addEventListner ('click', playPauseMedia);`

create a `function playPauseMedia();`

## Chapter 9: pages 201-206
### Bookmark/Skim

**Flash is no longer supported by many browsers but is an important part of history.**
