### loop

just as it says, you loop through code until a certain condition is set to false.  A condition would be met and then the code would stop running.

### while

code that is run until a condition is true. Once False is obrained the code stops running

### for

For loop uses a counter as a condition

### condition

A Condition is a specific True or FALSE statment

### increment

``` 'i++' ```

### decrement

``` 'i--'  ```

Logical Operators

``` '||' ```  logical or

``` '&&' ``` logical and

``` !  Bang ```
``` !== - not strickly equal```

``` <=  Less than or equal to ```



``` if (true) {

    // do the thing

}  else {

    // do this other thing

 } ```



  
```  while(true){

       // do the thing

}
```

This FOR loop is very important

```
  var count = 5

    for(var i - 0; i < count; i++ ){

    // does the thing

}

```
``` isNan("")

while loops are very important

```var count;
while (isNan(count) || count ===''){
  count=prompt('Enter a number plrease.')

}
]


Best practice it to use "Strict" 

assignment - use one while and one for loop
