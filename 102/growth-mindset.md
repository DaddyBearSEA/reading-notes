I had a Hotel Manager that taught me that a client issue is an opportunity to shine. Under promise - over deliver. In the massage world, you leave your bias at the door. You can't know what's going on until you get your hands on the person, testing range of motion, feeling the motion, listening to the patient's complaints.  Looking at the issue from above and below! Knee pain can be anything from wrong shoes to low back imbalance.  
1. Keep and open mind and look at issues from all angles - you are hear to learn and grow
1. Obstacles are just barriers to break down and *Seize the Opportunity*
1. You can learn from eveyrone, In massage, the patient is the teacher, the therapist is only the fascilitator.
