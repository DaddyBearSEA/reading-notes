### How computers Work: What makes a computer, a computer?

- Computers are EVERYWHERE!

We've always made machines to help us for manual labor. Thinking machines 
1. Take Input
2. Store Information
3. Process information
4. Out put information

I use to work on RPG with CARDS!  UGH!  I also use to work with the Magnetic Tapes.  My first floppy was a 8" floppy.

"Get off my lawn!" - I feel so OLD!

Input from keyboards, sensors, voice or sound, into storage where processing can happen

Algorithms - a series of commands.

Outout depends on the reason for the computer program.


### Binary Data
``` 1 and Zero ```

No on today deals with ones and zeros.  On and Off

- On / Off
- True / False
- 0 / 1
- Yes / No

Bits - 1 and zeros

### The Binary Decimal System
Zero and One - 
so 9 = 1 0 0 1 in binary

Everything is represented by numbers - 8 bit or 32 bit etc

Everything related to computers is binary


### Circuits and Logic

Circuts are controlled by 0 and 1. 

combining circuits creates logic.

Logic Gates - ADDER Circuit 

circuits are smaller today.  smaller circuits can do billions of computations per second. 


### CPU, Memory, Input & Output

Input > converts to a binary number > computer "CPU" runs the binary number to store the information > output to the screen when needed.

Thosands of instructions as you type to the CPU and then to memory.

### Hardware and Software

hardware is made up of
1. Circuits
1. Chips
1. Wires
1. Speakers
1. Plugs
1. Stuff

what you don't see is the Software. Software can be anything

CPU - Central Processing Unit

CPU - Master Chip that controlls all the other parts of the comptuer

TRON comes to mind with this video!

No one writes software in binary - most looks like
- Python
- Ruby
- Blockly

How does the computer figure out what to run - 
Operating Systems
- Windows
- Apple
- Linux
- Android

Yup - TRON!
