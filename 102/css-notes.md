hsl ( Hue =0 - 360, Saturateion =% and Light = %)

## HSLA

Alphe Value - adds opacity to the color  value is 0 - 1.0  Transparency - adding white or black to the color

#### Heirachry of colors
Some browsers don't allow for elaborate colors, so when using colors, Two step rule for browsers

1. Use a HEX, Color Name, or RGB
2. Use RGBA Value

If the browswer recognizes the RGBA value, everything is great - if not it falls back to Rule 1

## Hex codes  

```#ff3344``` # followeed by 3 pairs of letters and numbers to represent RGB

```color: #ff33ff;```

## Anatomy of CSS

• Rule - CSS have rules and inheritance within the code. 

## Selectors  Page 237. 292

element, universl, class (begins with periods), id (begins with a #)

p {

  color: black
}

• Rule - Last Rule - So if you use two <p> rules, it will use the second as that

• Inheritance - When creating style in the `<body>` the child elements will inherit the style

### Selector

>Emmet Syntax allows you to put a few letters in and you get the syntax.  There is so much more to explore.  

#### Property & value

- Property - Color is the property
- Value - Black is the Value

### Declaration

property value pair

### Curly braces  

used to created the code for the CSS and is also used in JS

### Class and ID Attributes

Difference between id and class attribute: The only difference between them is that “id” is unique in a page and can only apply to at most one element, while “class” selector can apply to multiple elements.
