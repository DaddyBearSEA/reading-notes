### Refactoring

> is a disciplined technique for restructuring an existing body of code, altering its internal structure without changing its external behavior. [for more info](https://refactoring.com/) "Refactoring.com" by Martin Fowler


**NOTE:** naming a variable is important. see Page 69 for rules on nameing a variable

#### why Use functions
- don't repeast yourself
- what does name imply? --- what the function "does"
- avoid repreatted code?  why? single point of "truth"

## What is a function
- Reuseable step by step chung of code
- does it run faster? No
