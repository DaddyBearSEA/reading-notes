Some basics broken into 4 thoughts

1. Audience - who is your demograhic for your website
2. Organization of your content
3. Presentation of the content
4. Attractive and Professional design to meet the target audience

### Demographic of Audience

Know your target clientele and why they want to come to your website.  Give them the informaton that they seek on your site.

### Motivational Goals

Why are they visiting your web site and what information are they expecting to find.

**NOTE: when taking over an existing website, look for analysis of the current traffic and what demographic is already present.**

### Site Maps

How will you organize your content for the website. Use a tool called Card Sorting and lay out the information.  Index Card or and Excel Spreadsheet is nice to lay things out. 

Then off to WIREFRAMES - Photoshop has templates for this.
