#### Day 2 of 102 
Today is all about setting up the computer. To have everything local on my hard drive. It's been awhile since I had to do command prompts from the OLD DOS days, but doesn't look like it's changed that much.

- Print working directory **'pwd'**
- list the documents, file folders and misc in the directory **'ls'**
- Change directory **'cd'**
  - change directory forward **'cd / name of dir'**
  - change directory backward **'cd ..'**
- You can always get help with the following after the command **' --help'** 
  - 'ls --help'
  -  'pwd --help'
  - 'cd --help'
- Everything is a file and the type of file is the '.ABC' after
  - '.jpg'
  - '.png'
  - '.jpeg'
  - '.gif'
  - '.txt'
  - '.pdf'
 - why type ' ' ' rather than ' " ' due to number of key strokes
