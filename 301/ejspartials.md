# [EJS Partials](https://medium.com/@henslejoseph/ejs-partials-f6f102cb7433)

Partials come in handy when you want to reuse the same HTML across multiple views. Think of partials as functions, they make large websites easier to maintain as you donâ€™t have to go and change a piece of text in every page it appears in.

***Instead, you define that reusable bundle of code in a file andinclude it wherever you need it.***


- When you look at a web page and see the same navigation and footer, that is where partials are perfect

- view/partials/ footer.ejs and navbar.ejs

> Now that we have our partials defined, we can use them in our home.ejs and post.ejs templates! In EJS, any JavaScript or non-HTML syntax you include in your templates is always surrounded by <% %> delimiters (you could change these delimiters if you really wanted to).
Including a partial in EJS is quite straightforward. You use <%- include( PARTIAL_FILE ) %> where the partial file is relative to the template you use it in.
