## Chapter 4: Ch.4 “Links” (pp.74-93)




## Chapter 15: “Layout” (pp.358-404)
Note: This layout chapter is BIG. Focus your attention on understanding the core concepts presented on pp.358-364, and look at the code samples on the website that accompanies the textbook. You will have another reading assignment on this chapter, so do not try to digest it all now.

## Article: [“6 Reasons for Pair Programming”](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

1. Greater Efficiancy
    > Research indicates that pair programing takes slightly longer, but produces higher-quality code
1. Engaged Collaboration
    > the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone

    > Codefellows rule is 15 Minutes
1. Learning from fellow Students

    > Everyone has a different approach to problem solving; working with a teammate can expose developers to techniques they otherwise would not have thought of.

1. Social Skills
    > getting good at finding the right words is a skill unto itself

    > Pair programming is great for improving social skills. When working with someone who has a different coding style, communication is key.

1. Job Interview readiness

    > many interview processes involves pair programming between a current employee and an applicant

    > the ability to work with and learn from others and stellar communication skills are as (or more!) important to a company than specific technical skills. Ryan Pederson from MS in the PPHH said this exact thing!


1. Work Environment readiness

    > Many companies that utilize pair programing expect to train fresh hires from CS-degree programs on how they operate to actually deliver a product. 
    
    > Code Fellows graduates who are already familiar with how pairing works can hit the ground running at a new job, with one less hurdle to overcome.
